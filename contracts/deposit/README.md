# Validator Deposit Contract Local Copy

This package contains a copy of the official Ethereum [Validator Deposit Contract](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/e4a9c5fa29def20c4264cd860868f131d6f40e72/solidity_deposit_contract) along with its ABI, bytecode, and Go bindings generated by go-ethereum's [abigen](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd/abigen) `version 1.10.4-stable`. It contains useful test harnesses for setting up and deploying a validator deposit contract using Go bindings, which are used across tests in Prysm.
