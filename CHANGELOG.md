## [v5.1.1](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v5.1.0...v5.1.1) - 2024-10-15

This release has a number of features and improvements. Most notably, the feature flag 
`--enable-experimental-state` has been flipped to "opt out" via `--disable-experimental-state`. 
The experimental state management design has shown significant improvements in memory usage at
runtime. Updates to libp2p's gossipsub have some bandwidith stability improvements with support for
IDONTWANT control messages. 

The gRPC gateway has been deprecated from Prysm in this release. If you need JSON data, consider the
standardized beacon-APIs. 

Updating to this release is recommended at your convenience.

This minor patch release has some nice improvements over the recent v5.0.0 for Deneb. We have minimized this patch
release to include only low risk and valuable fixes or features ahead of the upcoming network upgrade on March 13th.

Deneb is scheduled for mainnet epoch 269568 on March 13, 2024 at 01:55:35pm UTC. All operators MUST update their Prysm
software to v5.0.0 or later before the upgrade in order to continue following the blockchain.

### Security

Prysm version v5.0.0 or later is required to maintain participation in the network after the Deneb upgrade.

## [v5.0.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.2.1...v5.0.0)

Behold the Prysm v5 release with official support for Deneb on Ethereum mainnet!

Deneb is scheduled for mainnet epoch 269568 on March 13, 2024 at 01:55:35pm UTC. All operators MUST update their Prysm
software to v5.0.0 or later before the upgrade in order to continue following the blockchain.

This release brings improvements to the backfill functionality of the beacon node to support backfilling blobs. If
running a beacon node with checkpoint sync, we encourage you to test the backfilling functionality and share your
feedback. Run with backfill enabled using the flag --enable-experimental-backfill.

Known Issues

- --backfill-batch-size with a value of 1 or less breaks backfill.
- Validator client on v4.2.0 or older uses some API methods that are incompatible with beacon node v5. Ensure that you
  have updated the beacon node and validator client to v4.2.1 and then upgrade to v5 or update both processes at the
  same time to minimize downtime.

### Added

- Support beacon_committee_selections
- /eth/v1/beacon/deposit_snapshot
- Docker images now have coreutils pre-installed
- da_waited_time_milliseconds tracks total time waiting for data availablity check in ReceiveBlock

### Changed

- --clear-db and --force-clear-db flags now remove blobs as well as beaconchain.db
- EIP-4881 is now on by default.
- Updates filtering logic to match spec
- Verbose signature verification is now on by default
- gossip_block_arrival_milliseconds and gossip_block_verification_milliseconds measure in
- milliseconds instead of nanoseconds
- aggregate_attestations_t1 histogram buckets have been updated
- Reduce lookahead period from 8 to 4. This reduces block batch sizes during sync to account for
- larger blocks in deneb.
- Update gohashtree to v0.0.4-beta
- Various logging improvements
- Improved operations during syncing
- Backfill starts after initial-sync is complete

### Deprecated

## [v4.2.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.1.1...v4.2.0) - 2024-01-11

Happy new year! We have an incredibly exciting release to kick off the new year. This release is **strongly recommended
** for all operators to update as it has many bug fixes, security patches, and features that will improve the Prysm
experience on mainnet. This release has so many wonderful changes that we've deviated from our normal release notes
format to aptly categorize the changes.

### Highlights

#### Upgrading / Downgrading Validators

There are some API changes bundled in this release that require you to upgrade or downgrade in particular order. If the
validator is updated before the beacon node, it will see repeated 404 errors at start up until the beacon node is
updated as it uses a new API endpoint introduced in v4.2.0.

:arrow_up_small:  **Upgrading**: Upgrade the beacon node, then the validator.
:arrow_down_small: **Downgrading**: Downgrade the validator to v4.1.1 then downgrade the beacon node.

#### Deneb Goerli Support

This release adds in full support for the upcoming deneb hard fork on goerli next week on January 17th.

#### Networking Parameter Changes

This release increases the default peer count to 70 from 45. The reason this is done is so that node's running
with default peer counts can perform their validator duties as expected. Users who want to use the old peer count
can add in `--p2p-max-peers=45` as a flag.

#### Profile Guided Optimization

This release has binaries built using PGO, for more information on how it works feel free to look
here: https://tip.golang.org/doc/pgo .
This allows the go compiler to build more optimized Prysm binaries using production profiles and workloads.

#### ARM Supported Docker Images

Our docker images now support amd64 and arm64 architecture! This long awaited feature is finally here for Apple Silicon
and Raspberry Pi users.

## [v4.0.7](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.0.6...v4.0.7) - 2023-07-13

Welcome to the v4.0.7 release of Prysm! This recommended release contains many essential optimizations since v4.0.6.

Highlights:

- The validator proposal time for slot 0 has been reduced by 800ms. Writeup and PR
- The attestation aggregation time has been reduced by 400ms—roughly 75% with all subnets subscribed. Flag
  --aggregate-parallel. PR. This is only useful if running more than a dozen validator keys. The more subnets your node
  subscribe to, the more useful.
- The usage of fork choice lock has been reduced and optimized, significantly reducing block processing time. This
  results in a higher proposal and attest rate. PR
- The block proposal path has been optimized with more efficient copies and a better pruning algorithm for pending
  deposits. PR and PR
- Validator Registration cache is enabled by default, this affects users who have used webui along with mevboost. Please
  review PR for details.

Note: We remind our users that there are two versions of the cryptographic library BLST, one is "portable" and less
performant, and another is "non-portable" or "modern" and more performant. Most users would want to use the second one.
You can set the environment variable USE_PRYSM_MODERN=true when using prysm.sh. The released docker images are using the
non-portable version by default.

### Added

- Optimize multiple validator status query
- Track optimistic status on head

## [v4.0.6](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.0.5...v4.0.6) - 2023-07-15

Welcome to v4.0.6 release of Prysm! This recommended release contains many essential optimizations since v4.0.5. Notable
highlights:

Better handling of state field trie under late block scenario. This improves the next slot proposer's proposed time
Better utilization of next slot cache under various conditions

**Important read:**

1.) We use this opportunity to remind you that two different implementations of the underlying cryptographic library
BLST exist.

- portable: supports every CPU made in the modern era
- non-portable: more performant but requires your CPU to support special instructions

Most users will want to use the "non-portable" version since most CPUs support these instructions. Our docker builds are
now non-portable by default. Most users will benefit from the performance improvements. You can run with the "portable"
versions if your CPU is old or unsupported. For binary distributions and to maintain backward compatibility with older
versions of prysm.sh or prysm.bat, users that want to benefit from the non-portable performance improvements need to add
an environment variable, like so: USE_PRYSM_MODERN=true prysm.sh beacon-chain prefix, or download the "non-portable"
version of the binaries from the github repo.

2.) A peering bug that led to nodes losing peers gradually and eventually needing a restart has been patched. Nodes
previously affected by it can remove the --disable-resource-manager flag from v4.0.6 onwards.

### Added

- Copy state field tries for late block
- Utilize next slot cache correctly under late block scenario
- Epoch boundary uses next slot cache
- Beacon API broadcast_validation to block publishing
- Appropriate Size for the P2P Attestation Queue
- Flag --disable-resource-manager to disable resource manager for libp2p
- Beacon RPC start and end block building time logs
- Prysmctl: output proposer settings
- Libp2p patch
- Handle trusted peers for libp2p
- Spec test v1.4.0-alpha.1

### Changed

- Use fork-choice store to validate sync message faster
- Proposer RPc unblind block workflow
- Restore flag disable-peer-scorer
- Validator import logs improvement
- Optimize zero hash comparisons in forkchoice
- Check peer threshold is met before giving up on context deadline
- Cleanup of proposer payload ID cache
- Clean up set execution data for proposer RPC
- Update Libp2p to v0.27.5
- Always Favour Yamux for Multiplexing
- Ignore Phase0 Blocks For Monitor
- Move hash tree root to after block broadcast
- Use next slot cache for sync committee
- Log validation time for blocks
- Change update duties to handle all validators exited check
- Ignore late message log

### Removed

- SubmitblindBlock context timeout

### Fixed

- Sandwich attack on honest reorgs
- Missing config yamls for specific domains
- Release lock before panic for feed
- Return 500 in `/eth/v1/node/peers` interface
- Checkpoint sync uses correct slot

## [v4.0.5](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.0.4...v4.0.5) - 2023-05-22

Welcome to v4.0.5 release of Prysm! This release contains many important improvements and bug fixes since v4.0.4,
including significant improvements to attestation aggregation. See @potuz's
notes [here](https://hackmd.io/TtyFurRJRKuklG3n8lMO9Q). This release is **strongly** recommended for all users.

Note: The released docker images are using the portable version of the blst cryptography library. The Prysm team will
release docker images with the non-portable blst library as the default image. In the meantime, you can compile docker
images with blst non-portable locally with the `--define=blst_modern=true` bazel flag, use the "-modern-" assets
attached to releases, or set environment varaible USE_PRYSM_MODERN=true when using prysm.sh.

### Added

- Added epoch and root to "not a checkpt in forkchoice" log message
- Added cappella support for eth1voting tool
- Persist validator proposer settings in the validator db.
- Add flag to disable p2p resource management. This flag is for debugging purposes and should not be used in production
  for extended periods of time. Use this flag if you are experiencing significant peering issues.
  --disable-resource-manager

### Changed

- Improved slot ticker for attestation aggregation
- Parallel block production enabled by default. Opt out with --disable-build-block-parallel if issues are suspected with
  this feature.

  previously validated signatures.
- Improve sync message processing by using forkchoice

### Fixed

- Fixed --slasher flag.

## [v4.0.2](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.0.1...v4.0.2) - 2023-04-12

This release fixes a critical bug on Prysm interacting with mev-boost / relayer. You MUST upgrade to this release if you
run Prysm with mev boost and relayer, or you will be missing block proposals during the first days after the Shapella
fork while the block has bls-to-exec changes.
Post-mortem that describes this incident will be provided by the end of the week.

One of this release's main optimizations is revamping the next slot cache. It has been upgraded to be more performant
across edge case re-org scenarios. This can help with the bad head attestation vote.

Minor fixes in this release address a bug that affected certain large operators querying RPC endpoints. This bug caused
unexpected behavior and may have impacted the performance of affected operators. To resolve this issue, we have included
a patch that ensures proper functionality when querying RPC endpoints.

- Dependency: Update lighthouse to v4.0.1

### Fixed

- Builder: Unblind beacon block correctly with bls-to-exec changes
- Block construction: Default to local payload on error correctly
- Block construction: Default to local payload on nil value correctly
- Block processing: Fallback in update head on error
- Block processing: Add orphaned operations to the appropriate pool

## [v2.1.1](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1) - 2022-05-03

This patch release includes 3 cherry picked fixes for regressions found in v2.1.0.

View the full changelist from v2.1.0: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1

If upgrading from v2.0.6, please review
the [full changelist](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v2.0.6...v2.1.1) of both v2.1.0 and v2.1.1.

This release is required for users on v2.1.0 and recommended for anyone on v2.0.6.

The following known issues exist in v2.1.0 and also exist in this release.

- Erroneous warning message in validator client when bellatrix fee recipient is unset. This is a cosmetic message and
  does not affect run time behavior in Phase0/Altair.
- In Bellatrix/Kiln: Fee recipient flags may not work as expected. See for a fix and more details.

### Fixed

- Doppelganger false positives may have caused a failure to start in the validator client.
- Connections to execution layer clients were not properly cleaned up and lead to resource leaks when using ipc.
- Initial sync (or resync when beacon node falls out of sync) could lead to a panic.

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v1.4.4...v2.0.0)

This release is the largest release of Prysm to date. v2.0.0 includes support for the upcoming Altair hard fork on the
mainnet Ethereum Beacon Chain.
This release consists
of [380 changes](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v1.4.4...f7845afa575963302116e673d400d2ab421252ac) to
support Altair, improve performance of phase0 beacon nodes, and various bug fixes from v1.4.4.

### Upgrading From v1

Please update your beacon node to v2.0.0 prior to updating your validator. The beacon node can serve requests to a
v1.4.4 validator, however a v2.0.0 validator will not start against a v1.4.4 beacon node. If you're operating a highly
available beacon chain service, ensure that all of your beacon nodes are updated to v2.0.0 before starting the upgrade
on your validators.

### Added

- Full Altair
  support. [Learn more about Altair.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/8473024d745a3a2b8a84535d57773a8e86b66c9a/altair/beacon-chain.md)
- Added bootnodes from the Nimbus team.
- Revamped slasher implementation. The slasher functionality is no longer a standalone binary. Slasher functionality is
  available from the beacon node with the `--slasher` flag. Note: Running the slasher has considerably increased
  resource requirements. Be sure to review the latest documentation before enabling this feature. This feature is
  experimental.
- Support for standard JSON API in the beacon node. Prysm validators continue to use Prysm's API.
- Configurable subnet peer requirements. Increased minimum desired peers per subnet from 4 to 6. This can be modified
  with `--minimum-peers-per-subnet` in the beacon node..
- Support for go build on darwin_arm64 devices (Mac M1 chips). Cross compiling for darwin_arm64 is not yet supported..
- Batch verification of pubsub objects. This should improve pubsub processing performance on multithreaded machines.
- Improved attestation pruning. This feature should improve block proposer performance and overall network attestation
  inclusion rates. Opt-out with `--disable-correctly-prune-canonical-atts` in the beacon node.
- Active balance cache to improve epoch processing. Opt-out with `--disable-active-balance-cache`
- Experimental database improvements to reduce history state entry space usage in the beaconchain.db. This functionality
  can be permanently enabled with the flag `--enable-historical-state-representation`. Enabling this feature can realize
  a 25% improvement in space utilization for the average user , while 70 -80% for power users(archival node operators).
  Note: once this feature is toggled on, it modifies the structure of the database with a migration and cannot be rolled
  back. This feature is experimental and should only be used in non-serving beacon nodes in case of database corruption
  or other critical issue.

### Changed

- Much refactoring of "util" packages into more canonical packages. Please review Prysm package structure and godocs.
- Altair object keys in beacon-chain/db/kv are prefixed with "altair". BeaconBlocks and BeaconStates are the only
  objects affected by database key changes for Altair. This affects any third party tooling directly querying Prysm's
  beaconchain.db.
- Updated Teku bootnodes.
- Updated Lighthouse bootnodes.
- End to end testing now collects jaeger spans
- Improvements to experimental peer quality scoring. This feature is only enabled with `--enable-peer-scorer`.
- Validator performance logging behavior has changed in Altair. Post-Altair hardfork has the following changes:
  Inclusion distance and inclusion slots will no longer be displayed. Correctly voted target will only be true if also
  included within 32 slots. Correctly voted head will only be true if the attestation was included in the next slot.
  Correctly voted source will only be true if attestation is included within 5 slots. Inactivity score will be
  displayed.
- Increased pubsub message queue size from 256 to 600 to support larger networks and higher message volume.
- The default attestation aggregation changed to the improved optimized max cover algorithm.
- Prysm is passing spectests at v1.1.0 (latest available release).
- `--subscribe-all-subnets` will subscribe to all attestation subnets and sync subnets in post-altair hard fork.
- "eth2" is now an illegal term. If you say it or type it then something bad might happen.
- Improved cache hit ratio for validator entry cache.
- Reduced memory overhead during database migrations.
- Improvements to beacon state writes to database.

#### Changed Metrics

**Beacon chain node**
| Metric                | Old Name             | Description                                          | References |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `beacon_reorgs_total` | `beacon_reorg_total` | Count the number of times a beacon chain has a reorg |            |

### Deprecated

These flags are hidden from the help text and no longer modify the behavior of Prysm. These flags should be removed from
user runtime configuration as the flags will eventually be removed entirely and Prysm will fail to start if a deleted or
unknown flag is provided.

- `--enable-active-balance-cache`
- `--correctly-prune-canonical-atts`
- `--correctly-insert-orphaned-atts`
- `--enable-next-slot-state-cache`

### Removed

Note: Removed flags will block starting up with an error "flag provided but not defined:".
Please check that you are not using any of the removed flags in this section!

- Prysm's standalone slasher application (cmd/slasher) has been fully removed. Use the `--slasher` flag with a beacon
  chain node for full slasher functionality.
- `--disable-blst` (beacon node and validator). [blst](https://github.com/supranational/blst) is the only BLS library
  offered for Prysm.
- `--disable-sync-backtracking` and `--enable-sync-backtracking` (beacon node). This feature has been released for some
  time. See.
- `--diable-pruning-deposit-proofs` (beacon node). This feature has been released for some time. See.
- `--disable-eth1-data-majority-vote` (beacon node). This feature is no longer in use in Prysm. See,.
- `--proposer-atts-selection-using-max-cover` (beacon node). This feature has been released for some time. See.
- `--update-head-timely` (beacon node). This feature was released in v1.4.4. See.
- `--enable-optimized-balance-update` (beacon node). This feature was released in v1.4.4. See.
- Kafka support is no longer available in the beacon node. This functionality was never fully completed and did not
  fulfill many desirable use cases. This removed the flag `--kafka-url` (beacon node). See.
- Removed tools/faucet. Use the faucet
  in [prysmaticlabs/periphery](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/periphery/tree/c2ac600882c37fc0f2a81b0508039124fb6bcf47/eth-faucet)
  if operating a testnet faucet server.
- Tooling for prior testnet contracts has been removed. Any of the old testnet contracts with `drain()` function have
  been removed as well.
- Toledo tesnet config is removed.
- Removed --eth-api-port (beacon node). All APIs interactions have been moved to --grpc-gateway-port. See.

### Fixed

- Database lock contention improved in block database operations.
- JSON API now returns an error when unknown fields are provided.
- Correctly return `epoch_transition` field in `head` JSON API events stream.
- Various fixes in standard JSON API
- Finalize deposits before initializing the beacon node. This may improve missed proposals
- JSON API returns header "Content-Length" 0 when returning an empty JSON object.
- Initial sync fixed when there is a very long period of missing blocks.
- Fixed log statement when a web3 endpoint failover occurs.
- Windows prysm.bat is fixed

### Security

- You MUST update to v2.0.0 or later release before epoch 74240 or your client will fork off from the rest of the
  network.
- Prysm's JWT library has been updated to a maintained version of the previous JWT library. JWTs are only used in the
  UI.

Please review our newly
updated [security reporting policy](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/SECURITY.md).

- Fix subcommands such as validator accounts list
