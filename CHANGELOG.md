## [v7.1.8](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/compare/v7.1.7...v7.1.8) - 2026-07-27

This is a highly recommended patch release containing multiple bug fixes improving the handling of early attestations for better inclusion. Several other bugfixes and ux improvements are also included. Some highlights:
 - libp2p bug fixed, improving network-wide propagation of early attestations. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17123)
 - Bug fix enabling validator clients using grpc to make timely attestations (resolving notification stream connection issues).
 - Builder client now automatically falls back to JSON when a remote builder rejects SSZ requests (415/406), so builders without SSZ support (e.g. Commit Boost) work without needing `--disable-builder-ssz`.
 - Numerous UX / quality of life improvements (see Added and Changed sections below).
 - Miscellanious small bugfixes (see the Fixed section below)
 - And of course, changes related to the upcoming gloas fork, including support for partial data columns (more efficient blob networking) and progressive merkleization.

### Added

- Gate the `--distributed` validator client flag when used without the REST API being enabled. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17151)
- Added shorter flag aliases: `--beacon-rest`, `--beacon-grpc`, and `--enable-rest`. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17159)
- Add `GET /prysm/v1/node/custody` endpoint exposing the node's data column custody state: custody group count, custody groups and columns, earliest available slot, supernode/semi-supernode status, and backfill progress. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17144)
- Builder client now automatically falls back to JSON when a remote builder rejects SSZ requests (415/406), so builders without SSZ support (e.g. Commit Boost) work without needing `--disable-builder-ssz`. Covers `GetHeader`, `RegisterValidator`, `SubmitBlindedBlock`, `SubmitBlindedBlockPostFulu`, and the Gloas `GetExecutionPayloadBid` and `SubmitBuilderPreferences` endpoints. Once a builder rejects SSZ, the client uses JSON for the remainder of its lifetime. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17137)
- Reorg late payloads in Gloas behind the `--reorg-late-payloads` flag when the PTC did not reach timeliness consensus. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/16933)
- progressive merklization functions in the ssz package. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/16847)
- progressive SSZ merkleization for Gloas beacon state. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/16860)
- hidden, experimental beacon node flag `--enable-progressive-ssz` to. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/16860)

### Changed

- GET /eth/v1/validator/payload_attestation_data/{slot} now returns 204 instead of 503 when no block has been seen for the requested slot, per ethereum/beacon-APIs#612. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/16851)
- Setting `--beacon-rest-api-provider` now implicitly enables the beacon REST API, so `--enable-beacon-rest-api` is optional. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17159)
- Changed the `producePayloadAttestationData` endpoint to take `slot` as a query parameter instead of a path parameter, per the latest beacon-APIs spec. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17155)
- Verify the proposer signature of by-root blocks before adding them to the pending queue. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17172)
- Removed the blinded execution payload envelope publish flow in favor of publishing the full signed envelope or envelope contents, per beacon-APIs #624. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17181)
- Envelope publish endpoint now returns after broadcast, moving local import off the RPC path. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17198)
- Updated geth to v1.17.4. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17019)
- Updated `go-libp2p-pubsub` to `v0.17.0`, which allows republishing a previously seen but never delivered message (e.g. an attestation ignored because its block had not arrived yet). [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17123)
- Reduce the Gloas Engine API get-payload timeout to 300 milliseconds. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17212)
- `--max-builder-consecutive-missed-slots` and `--max-builder-epoch-missed-slots` help text: Reports the mainnet config value as the default instead of a hardcoded, false and unused values. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17211)
- Validator client now retries only the failed next-epoch duties independently instead of re-pulling every duty, making duty updates resilient to transient beacon node errors. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17036)
- Upgrading to go 1.26.5 with security and bugfixes: [see golang changelog](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.26.5). [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17230)

### Deprecated

- `--interop-num-validators`, `--interop-start-index`, `--interop-eth1data-votes` and `--interop-write-ssz-state-transitions` are now hidden no-ops. Use [ethereum-package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package) for interop/devnet testing. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17164)

### Removed

- Removed the interop keymanager, mocked eth1 data votes, the SSZ state-transition dump helpers (`tools/extractor`), and the `interop` chain-config preset. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17164)
- Unused `data_column_obtained_via_el_count` metric that was never recorded. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17216)

### Fixed

- Fixed flaky pending attestation bucket tests by asserting on specific log messages instead of exact global log counts. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17154)
- Reset the self-build envelope signature failure budget every slot instead of tying it to a prune path that rarely runs. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17104)
- Set the bid gas limit on full forkchoice nodes restored via `MarkFullNode`, so bid validation no longer sees a zero parent gas limit after a restart. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17093)
- Fail the block data column availability check during initial sync instead of waiting indefinitely, so checkpoint sync no longer stalls when a block's custody columns are missing. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17152)
- Ignore Gloas data column sidecars from a future slot before queueing, preventing pending entries that are never pruned. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17157)
- Wait for the clock before starting the pending Gloas columns pruning routine to avoid a nil clock panic on startup. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17168)
- Apply the Gloas cross-fork state-diff pending_deposits against the anchor's pre-upgrade list, fixing a panic and state corruption when builder deposits are onboarded at the Fulu to Gloas fork with `--enable-state-diff`. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17158)
- Re-verify builder deposit signatures when an in-batch index reuse evicts a pubkey. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17111)
- Stop downscoring peers when pending Gloas data columns are pruned for a block root this node has not imported. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17170)
- Validator client now restarts its beacon event stream after a fallback host switch or after the stream dies. Previously the stream stayed bound to the old beacon node until a full restart, silently stopping head and payload-availability events — and with them reorg-triggered proposer-preference resubmission — even though the rest of the client kept working against the new node. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17120)
- A replaced event stream is now stopped and drained before its successor starts, so two streams can never feed the validator client's event loop concurrently, and a stream shutdown can no longer close the shared events channel out from under its replacement. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17120)
- Fail payload reconstruction in Gloas if correctness cannot be guaranteed. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17174)
- Validator client with the beacon REST API now fetches proposer duties from the v2 endpoint post-Gloas, so its dependent root is fork-aware and consistent with attester duties. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17171)
- Guard against a nil block dereference in Gloas execution payload envelope and data column gossip validation. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17184)
- Do not queue blocks that arrive earlier than the max clock disparity. Also move HTR computation after the timestamp check. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17167)
- Reject future-slot execution payload envelopes fetched by root and enforce pending caps, preventing an unbounded pending-envelope memory exhaustion. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17176)
- Remote web3signer keymanager: `NewKeymanager` now waits for the key-file watcher to initialize before returning and fails startup immediately if the watcher cannot be initialized, key-update notifications are sent without holding the keymanager lock, and keys are reloaded from the key file when the watcher recovers from a failure. This prevents a startup race, a potential lock-ordering deadlock, and a stale flag-only key set after watcher recovery. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17188)
- Clarified `validator accounts exit` prompts and final log message when `--exit-json-output-dir` is set: signed exits are only written to files and are not broadcast, so the messaging no longer implies validators were exited. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17177)
- Fix a panic in `GET /eth/v1/beacon/blobs/{block_id}` when a `versioned_hashes` filter matches a commitment that appears more than once in the block. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17199)
- Clear the attestation data cache when the head is updated. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17143)
- Validator now skips payload attestation with an info log instead of an error when no block exists for the slot. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17202)
- Use saturating arithmetic when computing the effective bid value during Gloas bid selection. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17207)
- A next-epoch duty fetch failure no longer disrupts the validator's current-epoch duties. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17036)
- Mark pending payload envelopes as seen only after successful import so transient failures can be retried. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17206)
- Skip unusable static peer ENRs without discarding other valid peer addresses. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17192)
- Count each PTC vote once in `forkchoice_ptc_vote_count` instead of on every re-application. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17214)
- Increment `new_payload_*_node_count` metrics on the Gloas payload envelope path. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17213)
- Accept execution payload bids building on the parent's empty branch, fixing valid bid rejections after a missed payload reveal. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17217)
- PTC payload attestation now reports blob data availability from the data column store instead of forkchoice payload insertion. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17222)
- `beacon_execution_payload_envelope_invalid_total` no longer counts internal processing failures, only invalid envelopes. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/17215)

## [v7.1.7](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v7.1.6...v7.1.7) - 2026-07-13

This patch release focuses on Beacon API interoperability, validator-client resilience, and a broad round of Gloas (ePBS) correctness and stability improvements.

Release highlights:

- **Gloas and builder APIs**: Added external builder bid selection and per-builder maximum execution payments, improved payload bid and attestation validation, and strengthened missing-payload and data-column recovery paths.
- **Partial data columns**: Drop messages for unsubscribed topics before SSZ decoding, preventing large partial messages for non-custodied subnets from blocking the shared gossip loop. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17074)
- **Beacon API and validator client**: Added SSZ support for proposer preferences, payload attestations, and validator balances; switched REST validator clients to `head_v2` with automatic legacy fallback; and added replacement hints for removed routes.
- **Resilience and failover**: Re-push proposer preferences after beacon-node failover, retry failed submissions, accelerate unknown-parent recovery, and prevent startup, REST-handler, builder-registry, and peer-address edge-case failures.
- **Database startup recovery**: Prevent a startup panic when the database returns a nil head block without an error; Prysm now logs the invalid head and starts fork choice from the finalized checkpoint instead. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17087)
- **Operator experience**: Reduced noisy beacon-node and validator-client logs, added clearer Gloas bid-selection and envelope-publication diagnostics, documented ordered REST endpoint failover, and improved error reporting for invalid P2P IP configuration.

### Added

- Accept SSZ (`application/octet-stream`) request bodies on `POST /eth/v1/validator/proposer_preferences`, matching beacon-APIs #608. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17054)
- Add `max_execution_payment` to the proposer builder config, the maximum execution-layer payment a proposer will accept from a Gloas builder. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17061)
- Submit per-builder proposer preferences and signed request auths from the validator client ahead of Gloas proposals, and forward the matching request auth in the block request. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17063)
- Queue payload attestations received before their beacon block and process them once the block arrives. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16909)
- Pull execution payload bids from external builders during Gloas block production, select the best of self-build, P2P, and Builder-API bids, and submit the signed block back to the winning builder. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17067)
- Added SSZ (`application/octet-stream`) response support to GET and POST `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validator_balances` (beacon-APIs #622). [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17077)
- Add a proactive request for the payload if we haven't seen it by the payload time. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16904)
- `make build [<bin>...] [flags=...]`: Build Prysm binaries without Bazel. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17007)
- `make run <bin> [flags=...] [-- <args>]`: Build and run a Prysm binary without Bazel. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17007)
- Add `ConnectionCounter` to the REST connection provider and `ConnectionGeneration` to the validator client interface, exposing a monotonic counter that advances on each beacon-node fallback switch (the gRPC provider already had `ConnectionCounter`). [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17066)
- Respond with `410 Gone` and a message naming the replacement route when a Beacon API route that was removed from the spec (e.g. `GET /eth/v1/beacon/blocks/{block_id}`, `POST /eth/v1/beacon/pool/attestations`, `GET /eth/v2/validator/blocks/{slot}`) is requested, instead of a bare `404 Not Found`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17133)

### Changed

- Validator client submits proposer preferences as SSZ by default, falling back to JSON if the beacon node returns 415. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17054)
- Validator client submits payload attestations as SSZ by default, falling back to JSON if the beacon node returns 415. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17064)
- Validator client requests `payload_attestation_data` as SSZ, decoding either an SSZ or JSON response. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17064)
- Retain `BuilderConfig` (relays, enabled, max execution payment) when upgrading proposer settings from v1 to v2 instead of dropping it. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17061)
- Request a block's unknown parent by root immediately on gossip arrival instead of waiting for the pending-blocks queue tick. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17057)
- REST Validator client now subscribes to the `head_v2` beacon API event by default instead of the deprecated `head` event. If the beacon node does not support `head_v2` (it rejects the subscription with HTTP 400), the validator client automatically falls back to the legacy `head` event, so it keeps working against older beacon nodes with no behavior change. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16980)
- The payload_attributes event no longer includes parent_block_number from the gloas fork onwards. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17037)
- Document that `--beacon-rest-api-provider` accepts comma-separated endpoints for ordered failover. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17084)
- Cleaned up Gloas proposer flow logs: consistent verbs, `self-build` builder index rendering, single bid selection line with source and gwei value, and publish duration on envelope reveal. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17082)
- Consolidated validator client submission logs: sync committee messages, sync contributions, and payload attestations are now summarized as one info line per distinct submission content per slot (with range-compressed validator indices), and the previous per-validator success logs were downgraded to debug level. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17083)
- Run `isAggregator` check concurrently in `validator.subscribeToSubnets` method body. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17085)
- `make gen`: Cache generation inputs to skip re-generating files that are already up to date. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17007)
- Ignore instead of reject execution payload bids whose fee recipient does not match proposer preferences. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17128)
- Update C-KZG to `v2.1.8`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17150)

### Removed

- Remove the unused top-level `max_execution_payment` proposer-option field in favor of the per-builder `BuilderConfig.max_execution_payment`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17061)
- Removed proposer index cache. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16582)

### Fixed

- Accept SSZ (`application/octet-stream`) request bodies on `POST /eth/v1/beacon/pool/payload_attestations`. The handler already decoded SSZ, but the route only registered JSON so SSZ submissions were rejected with 415. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17064)
- Allow SSZ responses on `GET /eth/v1/beacon/pool/payload_attestations`. The handler already supported SSZ, but the route's Accept negotiation only allowed JSON, making the SSZ response unreachable. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17064)
- Request the data column sidecars needed to validate a payload envelope when we do not already have them. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17070)
- Ignore execution payload bids that cannot be verified against the current head state instead of rejecting them. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17044)
- Return `execution_optimistic` correctly for reward APIs (block, attestation, sync committee). [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16526)
- Emit the correct `parent_block_hash` in the Gloas `payload_attributes` SSE event by carrying the exact hash sent to the engine, so it matches for a full head instead of reporting the parent's hash. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17071)
- avoid panic when event stream request creation fails [#16234](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/16234). [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16234)
- Stop logging skipped `payload_attributes` events for past proposal slots as an `ERROR` ("received an event it was unable to handle") in the beacon node event stream. The `errPayloadAttributeExpired` skip is now excused like `errNotRequested`, removing high-volume noise under ePBS. The `event_type` log field now prints the event type (`%T`) instead of dumping the full event struct. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17069)
- Fixed the attestation rewards API `ideal_rewards` response for Electra compounding validators with effective balances above 32 ETH. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17076)
- Submit the signed block to the winning builder even when local block processing fails after broadcast. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17079)
- Drop partial data column messages for unsubscribed topics before the SSZ decode so the shared gossip loop is not head-of-line-blocked. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17074)
- Recover from nil headblock in db at startup. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17087)
- Accept builder preference submissions without the `--http-mev-relay` flag, gloas builders are dialed per URL from the request auth. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17078)
- Drain pending Gloas data column sidecars on block processing so columns gossiped back for our own proposed block are imported and the payload is marked available. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17059)
- Fix race condition for reading `host` in REST `handler`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17092)
- Correctly populate attestation data (`FromAttData`) when logging in VC. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17081)
- Notify the execution engine of the head per imported batch during Gloas initial sync. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17109)
- Treat nil builder registry entries as reusable slots in `builderInsertionIndex` instead of panicking. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17096)
- Compute the validator client's mid-slot submission delay from `SLOT_DURATION_MS` instead of `SECONDS_PER_SLOT`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17098)
- Ignore instead of reject queued payload envelopes and payload attestations whose signatures fail against a possibly divergent head state. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17103)
- Surface undefined execution engine errors from gloas forkchoice updates instead of returning a nil payload ID that callers read as not proposing. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17094)
- Return deep copies from the payload attestation pool so later aggregation cannot mutate attestations already handed to block building. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17099)
- Apply fork choice PTC votes and enforce the current-slot check for payload attestations submitted via the REST pool endpoint. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17100)
- Order the Gloas branch before Fulu in the gossip block topic mapping so the epoch cascade returns the right block type. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17114)
- Hold the state lock in `QueueBuilderPaymentForSlot` and route builder pending withdrawal appends through one copy-on-write path. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17095)
- Guard the startup head block with `blocks.BeaconBlockIsNil` before use: `BeaconDB.Block` returns a nil block with no error when the root is not found, so the previous inner-block nil check still segfaulted the node at startup. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17110)
- Count PTC votes from duplicated validators (consensus-specs#5222): a validator sampled into the payload timeliness committee multiple times now has its vote recorded at every position it occupies, not only at `ptc.index(validator_index)`. Un-skips the corresponding `on_payload_attestation_message` fork choice spec tests. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17028)
- Verify submitted execution payload bids with the gossip rules and record them in the local highest-bid cache before broadcasting. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17101)
- Fix `execution_optimistic` decision for attestation rewards API: use ancestor so that block root is guaranteed inside DB. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17112)
- Treat an ENR port value of `0` as absent when building dial addresses, so peers advertising a zero port are no longer dialed at `/tcp/0`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17116)
- Re-push proposer preferences when the validator client connects to a different beacon node. The submitted-slot dedup cache survives runner restarts and beacon-node fallback switches, so a freshly connected node previously received no preferences for slots already marked submitted. A new runner (initial connect / health recovery) now propagates `forceFullPush` to the proposer-preference build, and a beacon-node connection change forces a full re-push. The change is detected via a monotonic connection counter (`ValidatorClient.ConnectionGeneration`, implemented by each transport client from its own connection provider) rather than the host string, so a round-robin bounce (host0 → host1 → host0) that replaces the connection is still caught. The switch signal is only consumed once a push is confirmed, and proposer preferences and builder registrations are tracked independently, so a failed re-push to the new node is retried on later slots. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17066)
- Retry failed proposer-preference submissions: a batch whose submission fails releases its dedup-cache reservations so the per-slot rebuild resubmits it, covering both the regular push and the reorg resubmission path. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17066)
- Detach the proposer-preference submission from the slot context so it can no longer be cancelled before the mid-slot submit delay elapses (matching the builder-preference submission). [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17066)
- Return an error for an invalid `--p2p-local-ip` or `--p2p-host-ip` instead of silently ignoring it. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17117)
- Wrapped the `payload_attestation_message` SSE event in the `version`/`data` envelope to match the beacon-APIs spec. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17145)
- Stopped serving data column sidecars of empty slots in the by range RPC handler, matching the canonical payload chain semantics of the execution payload envelopes by range handler. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17089)

## [v7.1.6](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v7.1.5...v7.1.6) - 2026-07-01

This patch release contains targeted gossip-validation, sync, and operator-facing improvements, alongside continued Gloas (ePBS), PeerDAS/data-column, builder API, and performance work from the release candidate.

Release highlights:

- **Gloas and builder APIs**: Continued Gloas block-production separation, stateless Gloas gRPC support, builder execution request types, builder API clients, proposer preferences, execution payload bid events, and payload-attestation handling.
- **Beacon API and operator polish**: Added SSZ-QL proof and length-query support, improved event-subscription error reporting, and introduced the `--postpone-shutdown-for-proposals` flag to defer graceful shutdown around upcoming proposal duties.
- **PeerDAS and data columns**: Improved pending-column handling, sidecar validation, RPC reconstruction paths, rebroadcast behavior, bounded availability waits for Gloas data columns, and cell-level data column dissemination via the `--partial-data-columns` flag.
- **Stability and performance**: Reduced allocations in randomness, KZG, and fork-choice paths; bounded Engine API capability growth; fixed trusted-peer address handling; and improved sync behavior around payload requests and unavailable payloads.

To learn more about how `--partial-data-columns` save bandwidth by exchanging selected cells and proofs, see [Prysm docs](https://prysm.offchainlabs.com/docs/learn/concepts/partial-columns)

Operators are encouraged to update to this release as soon as practical.

### Added

- Add `--postpone-shutdown-for-proposals` flag. When set, a graceful shutdown signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM, e.g. Ctrl-C on Linux) is postponed while a validator controlled by a connected validator client still has a block proposal duty in the current or next epoch. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16895)
- Added optional Merkle proof support to the SSZ-QL BeaconBlock query endpoint. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16345)
- `FieldTrie`: Add `ProveField` that returns leaf and proof for given field index. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16955)

- Add the Gloas builder API HTTP client and the proposer-settings max_execution_payment field. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16984)
- Add the `SubmitBuilderPreferences` validator RPC, forwarding proposer builder preferences to the configured builder and caching the per-validator max execution payment. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17005)
- SSZ-QL: support `len()` queries on the BeaconState and BeaconBlock query endpoints, returning the runtime length of a List (element count) or Bitlist (bit count) as an 8-byte little-endian value. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16967)
- Add `GetExecutionPayloadBid` and `SubmitSignedBeaconBlock` to the beacon node builder service, wrapping the Gloas builder API client and selecting the per-builder request auth. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17006)
- Fire an `execution_payload_bid` event when POSTing to `/eth/v1/beacon/execution_payload_bids`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16979)
- Gloas: reject `execution_payload_bid` gossip when the builder version is not `PAYLOAD_BUILDER_VERSION`, the blob KZG commitment count exceeds the per-slot limit, or `prev_randao` does not match the RANDAO mix. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17011)
- Builder execution requests (EIP-8282): builders are onboarded and exited via `BuilderDepositRequest`/`BuilderExitRequest` in the Gloas `ExecutionRequests`, replacing the deposit-credential and voluntary-exit onboarding paths. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16972)
- Use the `HasBlobs` Engine API to quickly advertise missing cells. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16774)
- hot state db for state diff. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16808)
- Gossip-level validation (slot, bid consistency, builder signature) on `POST /eth/v1/beacon/execution_payload_envelopes` for the default and `broadcast_validation=gossip` levels; failures return 400 and the envelope is not broadcast. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16960)
- `broadcast_validation=gossip` on the block publish endpoints now verifies the proposer signature before broadcast (previously a no-op); the default level is unchanged. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16960)
- Gloas block production falls back to a cached P2P execution payload bid when the local EL self-build is unavailable. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17042)
- gRPC support for the `--stateless` gloas self-build path (previously REST-only), serving both. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16943)
- Add a NextSlotStateReadOnly interface to allow read-only access to the next slot state. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17055)
- `SubscribedValidatorsCache` tracks attached validators via `beacon_committee_subscriptions` for CGC and `validating()` computation, but has prepare_beacon_proposer populating in case of using an old validator client. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16767)
- `validator_indices` field on `CommitteeSubnetsSubscribeRequest` (gRPC): a flat list of attached validators, independent of the (slot, committee) subnet dedup, so the BN cache tracks every attached validator. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16767)

### Changed

- Check the network size up front when computing subnet topic scoring params, replacing the per-subnet "rate is 0" warning spam with a single debug line that includes the active and required validator counts. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16954)
- proposer settings no longer recognize the builder option post gloas and introduces a new gas_limit option for proposer preferences, supported per validator and in the default config. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16762)
- the builder gas_limit and the new top-level gas_limit are independent signals: relay registrations keep reading builder.gas_limit pre-gloas, while proposer preferences read only the top-level gas_limit (falling back to the default config, then the chain default). [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16762)
- gas limit keymanager endpoint continues to update gas limit on a per validator basis post gloas. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16762)
- v1 proposer settings files remain supported without modification: a deprecation warning is logged on gloas-scheduled networks and settings are upgraded automatically in the validator client at the gloas fork, promoting builder gas limits to the top level unless one is already set. Settings already on v2 are never rewritten. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16762)
- During initial sync, check execution payload envelope data column availability synchronously and fail if columns are missing instead of blocking. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16994)
- Double the global per-peer RPC rate limit (5 → 10 req/s, burst 10 → 20). [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16780)
- Builder API requests and responses now use SSZ encoding by default. Use `--disable-builder-ssz` to fall back to JSON. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17022)
- Deprecated `--enable-builder-ssz` (alias `--builder-ssz`); SSZ is now the default for builder setups, so the flag is a no-op. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17022)
- Optimize deterministic randomness helpers to reduce runtime overhead and allocations in `crypto/random`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16695)
- Update consensus spec tests to `v1.7.0-alpha.11`, aligning Gloas with the release: split `ExecutionRequests` into a Gloas-specific `ExecutionRequestsGloas` (with builder requests) leaving Electra/Fulu at three fields, add `BuilderPendingPayment.proposer_index`, validate execution payload bids against `state.slot`/`PAYLOAD_BUILDER_VERSION`, and set `MAX_BUILDER_DEPOSIT_REQUESTS_PER_PAYLOAD` to 256. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16972)
- Remove the unused builder deposit-signature prefetch path (`DepositSig` cache, `prefetchDepositSignatures`, and `BatchVerifyDepositRequestSignatures`), dead since Gloas stopped onboarding builders via the validator deposit path. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17012)
- Batch-verify builder deposit request signatures in `ProcessBuilderDepositRequests` instead of one BLS verification per request. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17031)
- Split Gloas and pre-Gloas block production into separate `buildBlockGloas` and `buildBlockFulu` paths. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17040)
- Avoid a redundant 128 KiB blob copy and heap allocation in the KZG batch verification path by copying each blob directly into the preallocated destination. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17039)
- Avoid cloning a slice just to count it in the Gloas fork-choice best-descendant walk: `updateBestDescendantConsensusNode` and `tips` now use a `hasConsensusChildren` helper instead of `len(allConsensusChildren(...))`, removing a per-node heap allocation. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17048)
- CGC and `validating()` source their attached-validator set from `SubscribedValidatorsCache` instead of `ProposerPreferencesCache`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16767)
- FCU payload attribute builders fall back to `--suggested-fee-recipient` when no signed preference is cached. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16767)
- `prepare_beacon_proposer` (REST + gRPC) is a no-op post-Gloas; the VC stops calling it post-Gloas. `SignedProposerPreferences` replaces it. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16767)
- REST `beacon_committee_subscriptions` sends one `BeaconCommitteeSubscription` per active validator (no longer deduped by subnet) so the BN cache tracks every attached validator. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16767)
- Move peer-scoring of invalid block signatures to the gossip caller. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17052)

### Removed

- Deprecate legacy `--http-modules` flag. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16973)
- Deprecate legacy `--enable-db-backup-webhook`, `--slasher-rpc-provider`, and `--slasher-tls-cert` flags. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16997)
- tracked validator cache and prefer to use proposer preferences cache and subscribed validators cache. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16767)

### Fixed

- Skip payload attribute computation while the node is syncing, gated inside `getPayloadAttribute`. Computing attributes with a state far behind the wall clock processed thousands of slots per block, slowing sync to ~0.1 blocks/s. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16951)
- Emit the `proposer_preferences` SSE event for locally submitted preferences, not only those received over gossip. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16962)
- Validator client now surfaces a connection error when the beacon node rejects an event subscription with a non-200 status (e.g. HTTP 400 for an unsupported topic), instead of silently treating the error body as an empty event stream and dropping the subscription without any indication. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16965)
- Make `FullBeatsEmpty` fork-agnostic so pre-gloas heads report a full payload consistently across all head update paths. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16958)
- `IsOptimisticForRoot` now recovers the validated checkpoint's state summary using the checkpoint root instead of the queried block's root, so the optimism slot comparison is correct. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16969)
- Key the payload ID cache by parent payload status so a head empty/full flip cannot return a stale payload ID. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16959)
- Emit the `payload_attributes` SSE event after the Gloas fork; it previously stopped at the fork boundary because the Gloas forkchoice-update path did not fire it. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16964)
- Set bid KZG commitments on Gloas data columns during the data availability check so column verification can proceed during sync and backfill. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16988)
- Seed bid KZG commitments on Gloas data column sidecars during by-root sync verification so column verification can proceed. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16992)
- Downscore peers per invalid pending Gloas data column and penalize columns queued for block roots that never become known, preventing penalty-free flooding of the pending column queue. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16936)
- Increment the `builder_exits_processed_total` metric when a builder exit is initiated. The counter was defined but never incremented, so it always reported zero. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17008)
- Ignore payload attestation gossip when the state cannot resolve the slot's payload timeliness committee, instead of rejecting the sender. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17020)
- Recover payload insertion on forkchoice if available on db. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16981)
- Bound the data-column availability wait to one slot during batch sync, so unavailable columns error and retry instead of stalling import. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16978)
- Initial sync no longer requests data column sidecars for payload-absent Gloas slots, which previously wedged sync on `respondedSidecars=0`. Columns are now requested by revealed payload envelopes instead of the bid's `blob_kzg_commitments`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16976)
- Resolve the payload attestation committee against the slot-covering state so lagging nodes don't drop valid votes. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17021)
- Basic-auth credentials in beacon node REST/gRPC endpoint URLs are now masked in logs and error messages instead of being printed in plaintext. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17024)
- Backfill now seeds Gloas data column sidecars with their block's bid KZG commitments before validation, so Gloas columns no longer fail with `errNotFuluDataColumn`. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17029)
- Do not republish Gloas data column sidecars as partial columns. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17030)
- Downscore a Gloas data column forwarder at most once per orphaned block root instead of once per column. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17032)
- Re-broadcast pending Gloas data column sidecars once their block arrives and deferred validation passes. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17001)
- Fixed `engine_exchangeCapabilities` requesting an ever-growing list of engine methods. Fork-specific endpoints were appended to a shared slice on every execution client reconnect, causing the "Connected execution client does not support some requested engine methods" warning to grow unbounded with duplicate entries. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17004)
- Fix panic when adding a trusted peer using a multiaddr with no transport address. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/16757)

- Fix error when `notifyNewHead(V2)Event` is called with zero head slot. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17058)
- Ensure we read and write correctly to the seen cache for Gloas data columns. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17053)
- Ensure we attempt to reconstruct Gloas data columns when a validated data column side car comes in. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/17053)

## [v7.1.5](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/compare/v7.1.4...v7.1.5) - 2026-06-16

This release is dominated by Gloas (ePBS) fork development, alongside broad performance and memory optimizations, additional Beacon API event and endpoint support, and a round of gossip-validation and concurrency hardening.

Release highlights:

- **Gloas (ePBS)**: End-to-end stateful self-build, execution payload envelope production and processing over REST/SSZ (including blinded envelopes), payload attestation (PTC) duties wired through fork choice and the validator client, execution payload bid gossip validation, EIP-8045, and a new Gloas-aware `GET /eth/v2/debug/fork_choice` dump endpoint.
- **Beacon API**: New `execution_payload`, `execution_payload_gossip`, and `head_v2` event topics ([beacon-APIs #588](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/588)/[#590](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/590)), a `proposer_preferences` endpoint and SSE topic, and payload-attestation data/pool endpoints.
- **Performance & memory**: Validator-list endpoints now stream via `ValidatorsReadOnlySeq` instead of materializing all ~2.3M validators, builder lookups use an O(1) pubkey→index map, the committee cache updates asynchronously, and several allocation hot paths were trimmed.
- **Hardening**: Exact gossip subnet-topic matching, BLS signature verification on the REST attestation submission path, proposer-index and data-column sidecar bounds checks, and reclaiming per-peer rate-limiter memory on disconnect.
- **Concurrency**: Fixed several data races around head state and a TOCTOU in `stategen`, plus a concurrent map iteration fatal in the data-availability wait.
- **hdiff state storage**: Snappy-compressed full-state snapshots and new save-state duration metrics and logs.
- **Dependencies**: Updated to Go 1.26.4 and go-libp2p v0.44.0.
- **Client identification**: The commit-hash block graffiti now uses Prysm's correct two-letter client code `PM` instead of the stale `PR`. Prysm already advertised `PM` everywhere else — the Engine API (`engine_getClientVersionV1`) and the Beacon API (`GET /eth/v2/node/version`) — so this only fixes the graffiti, bringing it in line with the rest of Prysm and the code registered in the [Ethereum client identification spec](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/identification.md#clientcode) (e.g. `…GEabcdPMe4f6`). The change takes effect when the graffiti info is refreshed.

There are no known security issues in this release. Operators can update at their convenience.

### Fixed

- Run the `(slot, builder_index)` dedup before BLS signature verification in `validateExecutionPayloadBidGossip`. Duplicates of an already-seen bid now short-circuit without running `VerifySignature`. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/16832)
- Cap Gloas data column sidecar cell count by `MaxBlobsPerBlockAtEpoch` at pending-queue admission, and require `KzgProofs` length to match `Column`. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/16831)
- Fixed Gloas genesis block reconstruction so the body's `signed_execution_payload_bid.message` mirrors `state.latest_execution_payload_bid`, matching the body root committed to in `state.latest_block_header`. Without this, Prysm built a divergent genesis block (different `block_root` / `body_root` from other clients) and the validator client failed to propose at slot 1 with "parent root … does not match the latest block header signing root in state". Also initializes `parent_execution_requests` so the body's SSZ hash tree root can be computed. [[PR]](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/16821)

## [v7.1.4](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v7.1.3...v7.1.4) - 2026-05-22

This is a maintenance release with significant progress on the Gloas implementation alongside important production fixes and performance improvements. There are no known security issues in this release. Operators may update at their convenience.

Release highlights:

- **Gloas fork progress**: PTC (payload timeliness committee) duties, payload attestation pool and gossip, proposer preferences, execution payload bid processing, builder voluntary exit handling, data column sidecar validation, observability metrics, and block proposing with P2P bids are all wired up in preparation for upcoming devnet testing.
- **Memory optimization**: Validator state representation compacted from ~264 to ~128 bytes per validator, saving ~300–450 MB of heap on mainnet (~2.2M validators). This also reduces GC pressure.
- **Sync committee duties fix**: Eliminated expensive state replays when computing sync committee members for the current period, which previously caused periodic CPU spikes ([#16686](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/issues/16686)).
- **Missed attestation fix**: Newly-activated validators no longer miss their first attestation when using `--enable-beacon-rest-api` ([#16723](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/issues/16723)).
- **Monitor indices fix**: Corrected head, source, and target reporting when using the `--monitor-indices` flag ([#16801](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/issues/16801)).
- **Crash fix**: Resolved a nil panic in `fetchOriginSidecars` when the origin checkpoint block has been pruned from the DB ([#16824](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/issues/16824)).
- **State diffs (experimental)**: `--enable-state-diff` now supports reconstructing caches from DB via hdiff nodes. This feature is experimental and not yet recommended for production use.

## [v7.1.3](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v7.1.2...v7.1.3) - 2026-03-18

This release brings extensive Gloas (next fork) groundwork, a major logging infrastructure overhaul, and numerous performance optimizations across the beacon chain. A security update to go-ethereum v1.16.8 is also included.

Release highlights:

- **Gloas fork preparation**: Builder registry, bid processing, payload attestation, proposer slashing, slot processing, block API endpoints, and duty timing intervals are all wired up.
- **Logging revamp**: New ephemeral debug logfile (24h retention, enabled by default), per-package loggers with CI enforcement, per-hook verbosity control (`--log.vmodule`), and a version banner at startup.
- **Performance**: Forkchoice updates moved to background, post-Electra attestation data cached per slot, parallel data column cache warmup, reduced heap allocations in SSZ marshaling and `MixInLength`, and proposer preprocessing behind a feature flag.
- **Validator client**: gRPC fallback now matches the REST API implementation — both connect only to fully synced nodes. The gRPC health endpoint returns an error on syncing/optimistic status.
- **Security**: go-ethereum updated to v1.16.8; fixed an authentication bypass on `/v2/validator/*` endpoints.
- **State storage**: Initial support for the `hdiff` state-diff feature — migration-to-cold and DB initialization are now available behind feature flags.

There are no known security issues in this release. Operators can update at their convenience.

## [v7.0.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v6.1.4...v7.0.0) - 2025-11-10

This is our initial mainnet release for the Ethereum mainnet Fulu fork on December 3rd, 2025. All operators MUST update to v7.0.0 or later release prior to the fulu fork epoch `411392`. See the [Ethereum Foundation blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/11/06/fusaka-mainnet-announcement) for more information on Fulu.

Other than the mainnet fulu fork schedule, there are a few callouts in this release:
- `by-epoch` blob storage format is the default for new installations. Users that haven't migrated will see a warning to migrate to the new format. Existing deployments may set `--blob-storage-layout=by-epoch` to perform the migration.
- Several deprecated flags have been deleted! Please review the "removed" section of this changelog carefully. If you are referencing a removed flag, Prysm will not start! All of these flags had no effect for at least one release.
- Several deprecated API endpoints have been deleted. Please review the "removed" section of this changelog carefully. 
- Backfill is not supported in Fulu. This is expected to be fixed in the next release and should be delivered prior to the mainnet activation fork.
- The builder default gas limit is raised from `45000000` (45 MGas) to `60000000` (60 MGas).
- Several bug fixes and improvements.

## [v6.1.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v6.0.5...v6.1.0) and [v6.1.1](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v6.1.0...v6.1.1) - 2025-09-26

This release has support for Fusaka testnets as well as many mainnet improvements. Testnet operators are required to updated prior to the testnet fork date. See [PR #15721](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/15721).

Mainnet operators are encouraged to update per their regular update cadence. 

Note: This release was re-issued as v6.1.1 to distribute release assets without debug symbols. See issue [#15760](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/issues/15760).

#### Noteworthy improvements, changes and bugfixes:
- The `--disable-experimental-state` beacon-node flag has been removed, marking the full graduation of the [Copy-on-write design](https://hackmd.io/zlTJ6Qe_RiueT3y2R77BvA) for BeaconState fields, which reduces the memory overhead of keeping multiple BeaconStates in RAM for block processing. Congrats @rkapka!
- The behavior set by the `--attest_timely` flag is now on by default, with the flag itself deprecated.
- GetDutiesV2 introduced, lowering duty request latency and beacon-node load. Multiple other improvements and bugfixes have been made to harden the validator run loop.
- New validator flag `--max-health-checks` configures a validator to switch to a fallback beacon node after the given number of health check failures.
- Improvements to rest-mode validator, defaulting to SSZ where available and adding SSZ support to more Beacon API endpoints.
- Beacon API now honors the gzip content-encoding header.
- Log timestamps now include milliseconds.
- Full fusaka support for testnets! 

**Special thanks to external contributors!**: @Alleysira, @KaloyanTanev, @rose2221

- Fixed gocognit on propose block rest path. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/15147)

## [v6.0.1](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v6.0.0...v6.0.1) - 2025-05-02

This release fixes two bugs related to the `payload_attributes` [event stream](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/Events/eventstream). If you are using or planning to use this endpoint, upgrading to version 6.0.1 is mandatory.  
Also, a reminder: like other Beacon API endpoints, when a node is syncing, it may return historical data as `finalized` or `head`. Until the node is fully synced to the head of the chain, you should avoid using this data, depending on your application's needs.

We currently recommend against using the `--enable-beacon-rest-api` flag on Mainnet. As you may have noticed, we put a deprecation notice on our gRPC code, in particular on gRPC-related flags. The reason for this is that we want to eventually remove gRPC and have REST HTTP as the standard way of communication between the validator client and the beacon node. That being said, the REST option is still unstable and thus marked as experimental in the flag's description (the flag is `--enable-beacon-rest-api`). Therefore we encourage everyone to keep using gRPC, which is currently the default. It is fine to test the REST option on testnets, but doing it on Mainnet can lead to missing attestations and even missing blocks.

**Updating to v6.0.0 or later is required for Pectra Mainnet!**

This patch release has a few important fixes from v6.0.0. Updating to this release is encouraged.

## [v6.0.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v5.3.2...v6.0.0) - 2025-04-21

This release introduces Mainnet support for the upcoming Electra + Prague (Pectra) fork. The fork is scheduled for mainnet epoch 364032 (May 7, 2025, 10:05:11 UTC). You MUST update Prysm Beacon Node, Prysm Validator Client, and your execution layer client to the Pectra ready release prior to the fork to stay on the correct chain.

Besides Pectra, we have more light client API support, cleanups, and a few bugfixes. Please review the changelog below and update your client as soon as practical before May 7.

This release is packed with critical fixes for **Electra** and some important fixes for mainnet too. 

The release highlights include:

- Ensure that deleting a block from the database clears its entry in the slot->root db index. This issue was causing some operators to have a bricked database, requiring a full resync. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/15011)

- Updated default gas limit from 30M to 36M. Override this with `--suggested-gas-limit=` in the validator client. [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/14858)

Known issues in **Electra**:

- Duplicate attestations are needlessly processed. This is being addressed in [[PR]](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/15034).

Testnet operators are strongly encouraged to update to this release. There are many fixes and improvements from the Holesky upgrade incident.

Mainnet operators are recommended to update to this release at their regular cadence.

## [v5.3.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v5.2.0...v5.3.0) - 2025-02-12

This release includes support for Pectra activation in the [Holesky](https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky) and [Sepolia](https://github.com/eth-clients/sepolia) testnets! The release contains many fixes for Electra that have been found in rigorous testing through devnets in the last few months.

For mainnet, we have a few nice features for you to try:

- [PR #14023](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/14023) introduces a new file layout structure for storing blobs. Rather than storing all blob root directories in one parent directory, blob root directories are organized in subdirectories by epoch. This should vastly decrease the blob cache warmup time when Prysm is starting. Try this feature with `--blob-storage-layout=by-epoch`.

Updating to this release is **required** for Holesky and Sepolia operators and it is **recommended** for mainnet users as there are a few bug fixes that apply to deneb logic.

## [v5.2.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v5.1.2...v5.2.0)

Updating to this release is highly recommended, especially for users running v5.1.1 or v5.1.2.
This release is **mandatory** for all validator clients using mev-boost with a gas limit increase.
Without upgrading to this release, validator clients will default to using local execution blocks
when the gas limit starts to increase.

This release has several fixes and new features. In this release, we have enabled QUIC protocol by
default, which uses port 13000 for `--p2p-quic-port`. This may be a [breaking change](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/14688#issuecomment-2516713826)
if you're using port 13000 already. This release has some improvements for raising the gas limit,
but there are [known issues](https://hackmd.io/@ttsao/prysm-gas-limit) with the proposer settings
file provided gas limit not being respected for mev-boost outsourced blocks. Signalling an increase
for the gas limit works perfectly for local block production as of this release. See [pumpthegas.org](https://pumpthegas.org) for more info on raising the gas limit on L1.

Notable features:
- Prysm can reuse blobs from the EL via engine_getBlobsV1, [potentially saving bandwidth](https://hackmd.io/@ttsao/get-blobs-early-results).
- QUIC is enabled by default. This is a UDP based networking protocol with default port 13000.

## [v5.1.2](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v5.1.1...v5.1.2) - 2024-10-16

This is a hotfix release with one change.

Prysm v5.1.1 contains an updated implementation of the beacon api streaming events endpoint. This
new implementation contains a bug that can cause a panic in certain conditions. The issue is
difficult to reproduce reliably and we are still trying to determine the root cause, but in the
meantime we are issuing a patch that recovers from the panic to prevent the node from crashing.

This only impacts the v5.1.1 release beacon api event stream endpoints. This endpoint is used by the
prysm REST mode validator (a feature which requires the validator to be configured to use the beacon
api instead of prysm's stock grpc endpoints) or accessory software that connects to the events api,
like https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-metrics-exporter

### Fixed

- Recover from panics when writing the event stream [#14545](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/14545)

## [v5.1.1](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v5.1.0...v5.1.1) - 2024-10-15

This release has a number of features and improvements. Most notably, the feature flag
`--enable-experimental-state` has been flipped to "opt out" via `--disable-experimental-state`.
The experimental state management design has shown significant improvements in memory usage at
runtime. Updates to libp2p's gossipsub have some bandwidith stability improvements with support for
IDONTWANT control messages.

The gRPC gateway has been deprecated from Prysm in this release. If you need JSON data, consider the
standardized beacon-APIs.

Updating to this release is recommended at your convenience.

This minor patch release has some nice improvements over the recent v5.0.0 for Deneb. We have minimized this patch
release to include only low risk and valuable fixes or features ahead of the upcoming network upgrade on March 13th.

Deneb is scheduled for mainnet epoch 269568 on March 13, 2024 at 01:55:35pm UTC. All operators MUST update their Prysm
software to v5.0.0 or later before the upgrade in order to continue following the blockchain.

### Added

- A new flag to ensure that blobs are flushed to disk via fsync immediately after write. --blob-save-fsync

### Changed

- Enforce a lower maximum batch limit value to prevent annoying peers
- Download blobs for checkpoint sync block before starting sync
- Set justified epoch to the finalized epoch in Goerli to unstuck some Prysm nodes on Goerli

### Fixed

- Data race in epoch boundary cache
- "Failed reorg" log was misplaced
- Do not check parent weights on early fork choice update calls
- Compute unrealized justification with slashed validators
- Missing libxml dependency

### Security

Prysm version v5.0.0 or later is required to maintain participation in the network after the Deneb upgrade.

## [v5.0.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.2.1...v5.0.0)

Behold the Prysm v5 release with official support for Deneb on Ethereum mainnet!

Deneb is scheduled for mainnet epoch 269568 on March 13, 2024 at 01:55:35pm UTC. All operators MUST update their Prysm
software to v5.0.0 or later before the upgrade in order to continue following the blockchain.

This release brings improvements to the backfill functionality of the beacon node to support backfilling blobs. If
running a beacon node with checkpoint sync, we encourage you to test the backfilling functionality and share your
feedback. Run with backfill enabled using the flag --enable-experimental-backfill.

Known Issues

- --backfill-batch-size with a value of 1 or less breaks backfill.
- Validator client on v4.2.0 or older uses some API methods that are incompatible with beacon node v5. Ensure that you
  have updated the beacon node and validator client to v4.2.1 and then upgrade to v5 or update both processes at the
  same time to minimize downtime.

### Added

- Support beacon_committee_selections
- /eth/v1/beacon/deposit_snapshot
- Docker images now have coreutils pre-installed
- da_waited_time_milliseconds tracks total time waiting for data availability check in ReceiveBlock
- blob_written, blob_disk_count, blob_disk_bytes new metrics for tracking blobs on disk
- Backfill supports blob backfilling
- Add mainnet deneb fork epoch config

### Changed

- --clear-db and --force-clear-db flags now remove blobs as well as beaconchain.db
- EIP-4881 is now on by default.
- Updates filtering logic to match spec
- Verbose signature verification is now on by default
- gossip_block_arrival_milliseconds and gossip_block_verification_milliseconds measure in
- milliseconds instead of nanoseconds
- aggregate_attestations_t1 histogram buckets have been updated
- Reduce lookahead period from 8 to 4. This reduces block batch sizes during sync to account for
- larger blocks in deneb.
- Update gohashtree to v0.0.4-beta
- Various logging improvements
- Improved operations during syncing
- Backfill starts after initial-sync is complete

### Deprecated

The following flags have been removed entirely:

- --enable-reorg-late-blocks
- --disable-vectorized-htr
- --aggregate-parallel
- --build-block-parallel
- --enable-registration-cache, disable-gossip-batch-aggregation
- --safe-slots-to-import-optimistically

Welcome to Prysm Release v4.2.1! This release is highly recommended for stakers and node operators, possibly being the
final update before V5.

⚠️ This release will cause failures on Goerli, Sepolia and Holeski testnets, when running on certain older CPUs without
AVX support (eg Celeron) after the Deneb fork. This is not an issue for mainnet.

## [v4.2.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.1.1...v4.2.0) - 2024-01-11

Happy new year! We have an incredibly exciting release to kick off the new year. This release is **strongly recommended
** for all operators to update as it has many bug fixes, security patches, and features that will improve the Prysm
experience on mainnet. This release has so many wonderful changes that we've deviated from our normal release notes
format to aptly categorize the changes.

### Highlights

#### Upgrading / Downgrading Validators

There are some API changes bundled in this release that require you to upgrade or downgrade in particular order. If the
validator is updated before the beacon node, it will see repeated 404 errors at start up until the beacon node is
updated as it uses a new API endpoint introduced in v4.2.0.

:arrow_up_small:  **Upgrading**: Upgrade the beacon node, then the validator.
:arrow_down_small: **Downgrading**: Downgrade the validator to v4.1.1 then downgrade the beacon node.

#### Deneb Goerli Support

This release adds in full support for the upcoming deneb hard fork on goerli next week on January 17th.

#### Networking Parameter Changes

This release increases the default peer count to 70 from 45. The reason this is done is so that node's running
with default peer counts can perform their validator duties as expected. Users who want to use the old peer count
can add in `--p2p-max-peers=45` as a flag.

#### Profile Guided Optimization

This release has binaries built using PGO, for more information on how it works feel free to look
here: https://tip.golang.org/doc/pgo .
This allows the go compiler to build more optimized Prysm binaries using production profiles and workloads.

#### ARM Supported Docker Images

Our docker images now support amd64 and arm64 architecture! This long awaited feature is finally here for Apple Silicon
and Raspberry Pi users.

## [v4.0.7](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.0.6...v4.0.7) - 2023-07-13

Welcome to the v4.0.7 release of Prysm! This recommended release contains many essential optimizations since v4.0.6.

Highlights:

- The validator proposal time for slot 0 has been reduced by 800ms. Writeup and PR
- The attestation aggregation time has been reduced by 400ms—roughly 75% with all subnets subscribed. Flag
  --aggregate-parallel. PR. This is only useful if running more than a dozen validator keys. The more subnets your node
  subscribe to, the more useful.
- The usage of fork choice lock has been reduced and optimized, significantly reducing block processing time. This
  results in a higher proposal and attest rate. PR
- The block proposal path has been optimized with more efficient copies and a better pruning algorithm for pending
  deposits. PR and PR
- Validator Registration cache is enabled by default, this affects users who have used webui along with mevboost. Please
  review PR for details.

Note: We remind our users that there are two versions of the cryptographic library BLST, one is "portable" and less
performant, and another is "non-portable" or "modern" and more performant. Most users would want to use the second one.
You can set the environment variable USE_PRYSM_MODERN=true when using prysm.sh. The released docker images are using the
non-portable version by default.

### Added

- Optimize multiple validator status query
- Track optimistic status on head
- Get attestation rewards API end point
- Expected withdrawals API
- Validator voluntary exit endpoint
- Aggregate atts using fixed pool of go routines

- Log Finalized Deposit Insertion
- Move consensus and execution validation outside of onBlock
- Add metric for ReceiveBlock
- Prune Pending Deposits on Finalization
- GetValidatorPerformance http endpoint
- Block proposal copy Bytes Alternatively
- Append Dynamic Adding Trusted Peer Apis

### Changed

- Do not validate merge transition block after Capella

## [v4.0.6](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.0.5...v4.0.6) - 2023-07-15

Welcome to v4.0.6 release of Prysm! This recommended release contains many essential optimizations since v4.0.5. Notable
highlights:

Better handling of state field trie under late block scenario. This improves the next slot proposer's proposed time
Better utilization of next slot cache under various conditions

**Important read:**

1.) We use this opportunity to remind you that two different implementations of the underlying cryptographic library
BLST exist.

- portable: supports every CPU made in the modern era
- non-portable: more performant but requires your CPU to support special instructions

Most users will want to use the "non-portable" version since most CPUs support these instructions. Our docker builds are
now non-portable by default. Most users will benefit from the performance improvements. You can run with the "portable"
versions if your CPU is old or unsupported. For binary distributions and to maintain backward compatibility with older
versions of prysm.sh or prysm.bat, users that want to benefit from the non-portable performance improvements need to add
an environment variable, like so: USE_PRYSM_MODERN=true prysm.sh beacon-chain prefix, or download the "non-portable"
version of the binaries from the github repo.

2.) A peering bug that led to nodes losing peers gradually and eventually needing a restart has been patched. Nodes
previously affected by it can remove the --disable-resource-manager flag from v4.0.6 onwards.

### Added

- Copy state field tries for late block
- Utilize next slot cache correctly under late block scenario
- Epoch boundary uses next slot cache
- Beacon API broadcast_validation to block publishing
- Appropriate Size for the P2P Attestation Queue
- Flag --disable-resource-manager to disable resource manager for libp2p
- Beacon RPC start and end block building time logs
- Prysmctl: output proposer settings
- Libp2p patch
- Handle trusted peers for libp2p
- Spec test v1.4.0-alpha.1

### Changed

- Use fork-choice store to validate sync message faster
- Proposer RPc unblind block workflow
- Restore flag disable-peer-scorer
- Validator import logs improvement
- Optimize zero hash comparisons in forkchoice
- Check peer threshold is met before giving up on context deadline
- Cleanup of proposer payload ID cache
- Clean up set execution data for proposer RPC
- Update Libp2p to v0.27.5

## [v4.0.5](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.0.4...v4.0.5) - 2023-05-22

Welcome to v4.0.5 release of Prysm! This release contains many important improvements and bug fixes since v4.0.4,
including significant improvements to attestation aggregation. See @potuz's
notes [here](https://hackmd.io/TtyFurRJRKuklG3n8lMO9Q). This release is **strongly** recommended for all users.

Note: The released docker images are using the portable version of the blst cryptography library. The Prysm team will
release docker images with the non-portable blst library as the default image. In the meantime, you can compile docker
images with blst non-portable locally with the `--define=blst_modern=true` bazel flag, use the "-modern-" assets
attached to releases, or set environment variable USE_PRYSM_MODERN=true when using prysm.sh.

### Added

- Added epoch and root to "not a checkpt in forkchoice" log message
- Added cappella support for eth1voting tool
- Persist validator proposer settings in the validator db.

  for extended periods of time. Use this flag if you are experiencing significant peering issues.
  --disable-resource-manager

### Changed

- Improved slot ticker for attestation aggregation
- Parallel block production enabled by default. Opt out with --disable-build-block-parallel if issues are suspected with
  this feature.

## [v4.0.2](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v4.0.1...v4.0.2) - 2023-04-12

This release fixes a critical bug on Prysm interacting with mev-boost / relayer. You MUST upgrade to this release if you
run Prysm with mev boost and relayer, or you will be missing block proposals during the first days after the Shapella
fork while the block has bls-to-exec changes.
Post-mortem that describes this incident will be provided by the end of the week.

One of this release's main optimizations is revamping the next slot cache. It has been upgraded to be more performant
across edge case re-org scenarios. This can help with the bad head attestation vote.

Minor fixes in this release address a bug that affected certain large operators querying RPC endpoints. This bug caused
unexpected behavior and may have impacted the performance of affected operators. To resolve this issue, we have included
a patch that ensures proper functionality when querying RPC endpoints.

## [v2.1.1](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1) - 2022-05-03

This patch release includes 3 cherry picked fixes for regressions found in v2.1.0.

View the full changelist from v2.1.0: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1

If upgrading from v2.0.6, please review
the [full changelist](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v2.0.6...v2.1.1) of both v2.1.0 and v2.1.1.

This release is required for users on v2.1.0 and recommended for anyone on v2.0.6.

The following known issues exist in v2.1.0 and also exist in this release.

- Erroneous warning message in validator client when bellatrix fee recipient is unset. This is a cosmetic message and
  does not affect run time behavior in Phase0/Altair.
- In Bellatrix/Kiln: Fee recipient flags may not work as expected. See for a fix and more details.

### Fixed

- Doppelganger false positives may have caused a failure to start in the validator client.
- Connections to execution layer clients were not properly cleaned up and lead to resource leaks when using ipc.
- Initial sync (or resync when beacon node falls out of sync) could lead to a panic.

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v1.4.4...v2.0.0)

This release is the largest release of Prysm to date. v2.0.0 includes support for the upcoming Altair hard fork on the
mainnet Ethereum Beacon Chain.
This release consists
of [380 changes](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v1.4.4...f7845afa575963302116e673d400d2ab421252ac) to
support Altair, improve performance of phase0 beacon nodes, and various bug fixes from v1.4.4.

### Upgrading From v1

Please update your beacon node to v2.0.0 prior to updating your validator. The beacon node can serve requests to a
v1.4.4 validator, however a v2.0.0 validator will not start against a v1.4.4 beacon node. If you're operating a highly
available beacon chain service, ensure that all of your beacon nodes are updated to v2.0.0 before starting the upgrade
on your validators.

### Added

- Full Altair
  support. [Learn more about Altair.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/8473024d745a3a2b8a84535d57773a8e86b66c9a/altair/beacon-chain.md)
- Added bootnodes from the Nimbus team.
- Revamped slasher implementation. The slasher functionality is no longer a standalone binary. Slasher functionality is
  available from the beacon node with the `--slasher` flag. Note: Running the slasher has considerably increased
  resource requirements. Be sure to review the latest documentation before enabling this feature. This feature is
  experimental.
- Support for standard JSON API in the beacon node. Prysm validators continue to use Prysm's API.
- Configurable subnet peer requirements. Increased minimum desired peers per subnet from 4 to 6. This can be modified
  with `--minimum-peers-per-subnet` in the beacon node..
- Support for go build on darwin_arm64 devices (Mac M1 chips). Cross compiling for darwin_arm64 is not yet supported..
- Batch verification of pubsub objects. This should improve pubsub processing performance on multithreaded machines.
- Improved attestation pruning. This feature should improve block proposer performance and overall network attestation
  inclusion rates. Opt-out with `--disable-correctly-prune-canonical-atts` in the beacon node.
- Active balance cache to improve epoch processing. Opt-out with `--disable-active-balance-cache`
- Experimental database improvements to reduce history state entry space usage in the beaconchain.db. This functionality
  can be permanently enabled with the flag `--enable-historical-state-representation`. Enabling this feature can realize
  a 25% improvement in space utilization for the average user , while 70 -80% for power users(archival node operators).
  Note: once this feature is toggled on, it modifies the structure of the database with a migration and cannot be rolled
  back. This feature is experimental and should only be used in non-serving beacon nodes in case of database corruption
  or other critical issue.

### Changed

- Much refactoring of "util" packages into more canonical packages. Please review Prysm package structure and godocs.
- Altair object keys in beacon-chain/db/kv are prefixed with "altair". BeaconBlocks and BeaconStates are the only
  objects affected by database key changes for Altair. This affects any third party tooling directly querying Prysm's
  beaconchain.db.
- Updated Teku bootnodes.
- Updated Lighthouse bootnodes.
- End to end testing now collects jaeger spans
- Improvements to experimental peer quality scoring. This feature is only enabled with `--enable-peer-scorer`.
- Validator performance logging behavior has changed in Altair. Post-Altair hardfork has the following changes:
  Inclusion distance and inclusion slots will no longer be displayed. Correctly voted target will only be true if also
  included within 32 slots. Correctly voted head will only be true if the attestation was included in the next slot.
  Correctly voted source will only be true if attestation is included within 5 slots. Inactivity score will be
  displayed.
- Increased pubsub message queue size from 256 to 600 to support larger networks and higher message volume.
- The default attestation aggregation changed to the improved optimized max cover algorithm.
- Prysm is passing spectests at v1.1.0 (latest available release).
- `--subscribe-all-subnets` will subscribe to all attestation subnets and sync subnets in post-altair hard fork.
- "eth2" is now an illegal term. If you say it or type it then something bad might happen.
- Improved cache hit ratio for validator entry cache.
- Reduced memory overhead during database migrations.
- Improvements to beacon state writes to database.

#### Changed Metrics

### Deprecated

These flags are hidden from the help text and no longer modify the behavior of Prysm. These flags should be removed from
user runtime configuration as the flags will eventually be removed entirely and Prysm will fail to start if a deleted or
unknown flag is provided.

- `--enable-active-balance-cache`
- `--correctly-prune-canonical-atts`
- `--correctly-insert-orphaned-atts`
- `--enable-next-slot-state-cache`

### Removed

Note: Removed flags will block starting up with an error "flag provided but not defined:".
Please check that you are not using any of the removed flags in this section!

- Prysm's standalone slasher application (cmd/slasher) has been fully removed. Use the `--slasher` flag with a beacon
  chain node for full slasher functionality.
- `--disable-blst` (beacon node and validator). [blst](https://github.com/supranational/blst) is the only BLS library
  offered for Prysm.
- `--disable-sync-backtracking` and `--enable-sync-backtracking` (beacon node). This feature has been released for some
  time. See.
- `--diable-pruning-deposit-proofs` (beacon node). This feature has been released for some time. See.
- `--disable-eth1-data-majority-vote` (beacon node). This feature is no longer in use in Prysm. See,.
- `--proposer-atts-selection-using-max-cover` (beacon node). This feature has been released for some time. See.
- `--update-head-timely` (beacon node). This feature was released in v1.4.4. See.
- `--enable-optimized-balance-update` (beacon node). This feature was released in v1.4.4. See.
- Kafka support is no longer available in the beacon node. This functionality was never fully completed and did not
  fulfill many desirable use cases. This removed the flag `--kafka-url` (beacon node). See.
- Removed tools/faucet. Use the faucet
  in [prysmaticlabs/periphery](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/periphery/tree/c2ac600882c37fc0f2a81b0508039124fb6bcf47/eth-faucet)
  if operating a testnet faucet server.
- Tooling for prior testnet contracts has been removed. Any of the old testnet contracts with `drain()` function have
  been removed as well.
- Toledo tesnet config is removed.
- Removed --eth-api-port (beacon node). All APIs interactions have been moved to --grpc-gateway-port. See.

### Fixed

- Database lock contention improved in block database operations.
- JSON API now returns an error when unknown fields are provided.
- Correctly return `epoch_transition` field in `head` JSON API events stream.
- Various fixes in standard JSON API
- Finalize deposits before initializing the beacon node. This may improve missed proposals
- JSON API returns header "Content-Length" 0 when returning an empty JSON object.
- Initial sync fixed when there is a very long period of missing blocks.
- Fixed log statement when a web3 endpoint failover occurs.
- Windows prysm.bat is fixed

### Security

- You MUST update to v2.0.0 or later release before epoch 74240 or your client will fork off from the rest of the
  network.
- Prysm's JWT library has been updated to a maintained version of the previous JWT library. JWTs are only used in the
  UI.

Please review our newly
updated [security reporting policy](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/SECURITY.md).

- Fix subcommands such as validator accounts list

### Security

There are no security updates in this release.
