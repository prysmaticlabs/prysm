This is the core repository for Prysm, a [Golang](https://golang.org/) implementation of the [Ethereum Consensus](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) specification, developed by [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases) for details of the latest releases and upcoming breaking changes.

### Getting Started

A detailed set of installation and usage instructions as well as breakdowns of each individual component are available in the [official documentation portal](https://docs.prylabs.network). If you still have questions, feel free to stop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/CTYGPUJ) .

### Staking on Mainnet

To participate in staking, you can join the [official eth2 launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org). The launchpad is the only recommended way to become a validator on mainnet. You can explore validator rewards/penalties via Bitfly's block explorer: [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in), and follow the latest blocks added to the chain on [beaconscan](https://beaconscan.com) .
